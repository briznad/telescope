# Telescope
## Company data ingester

## What
Telescope is an app, database, and API.

## Why
To facilitate the inputting of company data, which is often exchanged in an unstructured format, into a structured system, allowing it to be used in data modelling.

## How
This project uses a wide range of technologies and solutions to build, deploy, host, serve, manage, and analyze. Some of them are SvelteKit, Ionic, Javascript, Typescript, Firebase Firestore, Firebase Auth, Google Big Query, Vercel Edge Functions, and many more.

Despite the fact that this was built as an interview project, I approached this as I would a production system. This system could be deployed to a production environment with minimal changes. However, I did have limited time to build, which informed my choices. I selected solutions that aided my ability to create the highest quality system in the shortest time. I'll detail those choices uses the requested prompts:

### The systems design [I] use
### Why [I] chose this approach
### Any systems recommendations to use

## Etymology
Telescope is named for James Webb - no, not the [second Administrator of NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._Webb) - we're talking about [the Australian competitive eater who can take down more chicken wings in 12 minutes than Joey Chestnut](https://youtu.be/7dyKpqLxJD4). He seemed like a fitting inspiration given that Telescope is all about efficient ingestion.
