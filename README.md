# Telescope
## Company data ingester

## What
Telescope is an app, database, and API.

## Why
To facilitate the inputting of company data, which is often exchanged in an unstructured format, into a structured system, allowing it to be used in data modelling.

## How

## Etymology
Telescope is named for James Webb - no, not the [second Administrator of NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._Webb) - we're talking about [the Australian competitive eater who can take down more chicken wings in 12 minutes than Joey Chestnut](https://youtu.be/7dyKpqLxJD4). He seemed like a fitting inspiration given that Telescope is all about efficient ingestion.
